# js_practice
Repo for contributors to work on JS skills


Pull this repo down by running in your terminal:

```

git clone https://github.com/martinfbrandt/js_practice.git

```


Open the .html file and test out the current functionality
There is code that needs to be completed, it's located in a script tag inside of the .html file

Before you write anything, create a branch off the main code in `master`.

``` 
git checkout -b 'some-creative-branch-name'

```

Add your code changes to this branch by running: 

```
git commit -m 'commit message, usually this is something helpful like what changes you made'

```

Finally, when you're ready to "push" your branch up to the remote repository, run 
```
git push

```
